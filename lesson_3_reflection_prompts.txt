1.  When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
    When you are working with others, and/or want to share your work.

2.  Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
    For adding in changes in a logical manner for where you are working within
    your project.
    So Git doesn't add changes to your project that you aren't ready for.

3.  Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?
    -Forks are clones made of repos only on GitHub. They allow for reference/credit
     to the author of the original directory.
    -Clones are copies of repos either from Github to your computer(local) or can be
      copies of a local repo to another location on your computer.
    -Branches are head commits with a label that allow you to 'branch off' in a direction
      to perhaps try a different version of your project, or try a feature that you don't
      quite yet want to be a part of your project.
